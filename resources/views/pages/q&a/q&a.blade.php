A pair of jeans and a shirt would be perfect. I am not really the <strong>fashionable</strong> type. But of course, I also <strong>dress up</strong> for special occasions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>What kind of clothes do people in your country usually wear</strong><strong>?</strong></li></ol><p>-Climate affects people’s clothing. I live in the tropics, so people in my country usually wear clothes with <strong>light fabrics</strong>. We also wear light-colored clothes. For <strong>casual attire</strong>, a <strong>pair of jeans</strong> or <strong>short pants</strong> and a <strong>shirt</strong> for men or <strong>blouse</strong> for women are common.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>How important is fashion to you?</strong></li></ol><p>-I am not much worried about it actually. I prefer wearing simple yet<strong> presentable</strong> clothes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>What kind of clothes do you dislike</strong><strong>?</strong></li></ol><p>-Well, I dislike wearing <strong>untidy </strong>and <strong>eccentric</strong> clothes. Example would be <strong>tearing or ripped jeans</strong>. I also avoid clothes with flashy colors or those that are too stunning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Do you think people behave differently in different kinds of clothes</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-Yes, I think people behave differently when they wear different clothes. For example, one who wears <strong>formal clothes</strong> may portray an image of being professional and confident. Wearing <strong>casual clothes</strong>, on the other hand, makes us look comfortable and relaxed.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>6.&nbsp;<strong>What kind of clothes do people wear to work in your country</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-Those who work in the corporate wear either <strong>smart casual </strong>or <strong>business/formal attire</strong> on a regular work day. Some employees such as teachers have <strong>uniform</strong>s. Other workers are allowed to wear casual clothes to works.</p></div><div class="row"></div><div class="col-md-6"><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Part 2</h3><p><strong>Describe someone you know who dresses well. You should say</strong></p><ul><li><strong>who they are</strong></li><li><strong>how you know them</strong></li><li><strong>what kind of clothes they wear</strong></li></ul><p><strong>and say why you like the way they dress</strong><strong>.</strong></p></div><div class="col-md-6"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me talk about a friend who dresses very well. Her name is Tina. We are of the same age and she is currently a professor in a prestigious university in my country. Although she is not in the fashion industry, she dresses <strong>fashionably</strong>. She is tall, not very slim and is very <strong>attractive</strong>.</p><p>She has been my friend since high school. I get to see her from time to time as she also lives in my neighborhood. We also spend time together with friends especially on weekends.</p><p>Actually, she doesn’t have a specific <strong>dressing preference</strong> or <strong>style</strong>. I think she bases her attire on the weather as well as on occasions and events, I usually see her wearing <strong>light colored dresses</strong> and <strong>high-heeled shoes</strong> when she goes to work. She also wears <strong>formal clothes</strong>. She is fond of<strong> accessories</strong> which looks fashionable. Her <strong>footwear </strong>always <strong>matches </strong>her dress. I think she has a huge collection of clothes, shoes and bags as I rarely see her wearing the same set after some time. I see her wear <strong>casual clothes</strong> too but they don’t look <strong>plain or boring</strong> on her.</p><p>I think she can carry herself very well in any kind of dress. She <strong>looks comfortable</strong> no matter what her attire is. She always looks clean and tidy. I like her style because she doesn’t <strong>dress extravagant</strong> or offensive. She always looks professional and presentable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><h3>Part 3</h3><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><ol><li><strong>How important are clothes and fashion to you? [Why/Why not?]?</strong></li></ol><p>Clothes and fashion are not that important to me. I always prefer comfortable clothes but making sure that I’d <strong>look presentable</strong> and clean. I am more of being practical in choosing what I wear.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>How different are the clothes you wear now from those you wore 10 years ago</strong><strong>?</strong></li></ol><p>Well, I can say that there hasn’t been much change with the clothes I wear now with that of about 10 years ago. I still wear the regular jeans and shirt for casual days or formal clothes on business events. But, I think since the trend has changed, the kind of these basic clothing has also changed for me, especially when it comes to the style of the jeans and shirts. I used to wear straight-cut jeans but nowadays, I wear contemporary style such as slim-fit clothes.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>What do you think the clothes we wear say about us</strong><strong>?</strong></li></ol><p>At times, I think the clothes we wear may show part of our personality or status. For example, clothing may determine the kind of job a person has. For some, it may be a tool for expression. Some could be stylish and fashionable which may reflect their personality as being creative.</p></div>
